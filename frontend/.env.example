# Backend API URL
# IMPORTANT: Browser runs on HOST machine and cannot resolve Docker service names
# So even in Docker Compose, use localhost with port forwarding (5000 -> 5000)

# For local development (Docker Compose OR running npm run dev):
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/auth

# For production deployment (on different domain):
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com/api/auth
